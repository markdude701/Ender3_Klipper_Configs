# Ender 3 Klipper Config
This is my personal Ender 3 Klipper config for a fairly stock Ender 3. Modifications are listed below. 

Printer / Config Modifications:
- Dual Z Leveling
- Mesh Bed Leveling
- Stock Ender 3 LCD screen
- Slice Engineering CopperHead Hotend
- Z-Tilt

THESE CONFIGS ARE PULLED STRAIGHT FROM KLIPPER SO SOME ITEMS MIGHT BE COMMENTED OUT OR SET ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CONFIG. 
Please double check any configs at the end of printer.cfg before removing a comment.
(Klipper will likely error out if you have multiple similar configs in the same file) 

Best of Luck! Hope that helps!
